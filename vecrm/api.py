"""HTTP-callable API surface for the VECRM app.

This module exposes whitelisted top-level functions that wrap internal
doctype methods. The wrappers decouple the HTTP API contract from the
internal implementation, so doctype methods can evolve without breaking
external callers (vecrm-portal, integrations).

Conventions:
  * Every function in this module is decorated with @frappe.whitelist().
  * Wrappers MUST NOT contain business logic. They locate the target
    document and delegate; transformations/validations belong on the
    doctype methods themselves.
  * Function names use snake_case verbs (e.g. ``convert_lead_to_inquiry``).

	  requirement: Required Inquiry field, passed through.
